# Security Policy

The maintainers of this project at Sterfive take security seriously and are committed to addressing potential security issues promptly and responsibly.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any `node-opcua` repository, please report it to us as described below. 

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release series will receive patches and new versions in case of a security issue. 

We may consider patching or fixing prior versions of `node-opcua` only for users who are regular subscribers to the NodeOPCUA Support Membership program ([https://support.sterfive.com](https://support.sterfive.com)).

 | Version       | Supported          |
 | ------------- | ------------------ |
 | 2@latest      | âœ… (master branch) |
 | 2.163 to 2<@latest |  (for members only) |
 | 0.x           | :x:                |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability


If you discover a security vulnerability within `node-opcua`, we appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing it to us.

To ensure a smooth and effective resolution process, please follow these steps:

1. **Confidential Reporting**:
  
   Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability. Instead, send a detailed report to our security team at `security@sterfive.com`, including:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any relevant code snippets or screenshots.
   - Your contact information (if you wish to be credited).

2. **Acknowledgment**: 

   We will acknowledge receipt of your report usually within 24 hours and provide an estimated timeline for resolution.

## Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Investigation

Our security team will investigate the reported vulnerability to assess its impact and validity. We may contact you for additional information if necessary.

### Remediation

If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will prioritize developing a fix. The patch will be included in the next release of `node-opcua`. For critical vulnerabilities, we may issue an emergency release.

### Notification

- Once the fix is released, we will notify you and credit you in the release notes, unless you prefer to remain anonymous. 
- Members of the [NodeOPCUA Support Program](https://support.sterfive.com) will be directly informed about the vulnerability and the steps taken to address it, 90 days before the official public announcement. This allows them to put in place a remediation plan. 
- We will then publish a security advisory to inform the broader community about the vulnerability and the availability of the patch.

### Coordinated Disclosure

- We encourage coordinated disclosure, where the vulnerability details are made public only after a fix has been released and our customers (members of the NodeOPCUA Support Program) have been confidentially informed. 
- This approach helps protect  our committed users by giving them time to update to the patched version before the vulnerability is publicly known and also addresses the security issue for the broader community.
